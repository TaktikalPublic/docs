title: Creating your first Fill & Sign Document
---

In this tutorial, we'll go through how you can use the Fill & Sign Editor to create a form.

Once a Fill & Sign Document has been created, you can open it within the Fill & Sign Editor. Given that the PDF had no form fields you will see something like so:

![Creating%20your%20first%20Fill%20&%20Sign%20Document%2027bc5648a39f45e2901a8e8615e3c9f6/Untitled.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled.png)

For the first part, we have four textfields:

![Creating%20your%20first%20Fill%20&%20Sign%20Document%2027bc5648a39f45e2901a8e8615e3c9f6/Untitled%201.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-01.png)

To create a textfield, you can click "Textfield" in the top-left corner of the document viewer:

![Creating%20your%20first%20Fill%20&%20Sign%20Document%2027bc5648a39f45e2901a8e8615e3c9f6/Untitled%202.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-02.png)

When clicked, you will notice a light blue box following your mouse.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 3.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-03.png)

When positioned correctly, you can click to create the field. You can also choose to click and drag to create a textfield of a specific size.

Once the field has been created, you can click and drag the corners and sides to resize the field to the desired size.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 4.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-04.png)

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 5.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-05.png)

That's one field down, three to go!

Since the "Name" field is correctly sized and positioned well, it would make sense to reuse it for the other three fields.

To duplicate the field, hold `Alt` (or `⌥ Option` on macOS) and click and drag the copy of the field to where you want it to be.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 6.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-06.png)

Note: To only move the field horizontally or vertically you can hold `Shift ⇧` while moving it. This works both when duplicating fields and moving existing fields. Try pressing and unpressing `Shift ⇧` while moving a field to get a sense of how this works.

The "ID num." field is now the selected field. We can add the "Name" field to the selection by holding `Shift ⇧` and just clicking it:

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 7.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-07.png)

Now that both fields are selected, we can duplicate them together just like we did with the "Name" field.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 8.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-08.png)

Now the textfields are in place. These are fields that the user must fill out so let's make them required.

Select them all by clicking and dragging a rectangle around them.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 9.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-09.png)

Once the fields are selected, you can take a look at the top-right section of the editor:

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 10.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-10.png)

We see that there are 4 selected fields, which is correct. By clicking on the "Required" checkbox we can ensure that the user fills out these fields.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 11.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-11.png)

You may also have noticed that there is a "Format" dropdown. It supports a few different formats that the user's input must match:

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 12.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-12.png)

We can use this to, for example, set the format email field's format to "Email". This means that the user will have to add a valid email address to continue.

Let's take a look at the current version of the document in Fill & Sign to see how the document looks. You can do that by clicking "Draft" in the "Open in Fill & Sign" section in the top-right of the editor:

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 13.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-13.png)

Once the document is opened, we see our four textfields:

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 14.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-14.png)

If we attempt to continue without filling them out, the required fields will be highlighted so the user knows what needs to be filled out:

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 15.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-15.png)

Back to the document. We now have a section where the user can select as many or as few of the options as he wants.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 16.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-16.png)

For this, we can use checkboxes. Click the "Checkbox" button in the top-left of the window to start adding a checkbox.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 17.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-17.png)

Then click to add the checkbox in the correct place:

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 18.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-18.png)

It's a bit bigger than I would like. We can drag the corner to resize it.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 19.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-19.png)

We can then do as we did with the textfields and duplicate the checkbox by holding `Alt` (or `⌥ Option` on macOS) and click-and-dragging the copy of the checkbox to where you want it to be.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 20.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-20.png)

We now have a list of checkboxes where the user can check as few or as many of the fields as he wants.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 21.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-21.png)

The next section is slightly different.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 22.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-22.png)

The user also has to select an option, but only one of the options.

This is a case for radios. Click the "Radio" button in the top-left of the window to start adding a radio.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 23.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-23.png)

As before, click to add the field in the correct place.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 24.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-24.png)

Just a tad bigger than I would like. We can make the field smaller like we did with the checkbox.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 25.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-25.png)

Once again, we can duplicate these fields by holding `Alt` (`⌥ Option` on macOS) and click-and-dragging the copy of the radio option to where you want it to be.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 26.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-26.png)

Radios work slightly differently than textfields and checkboxes. If you take a look at the list of fields on the left side, you notice that we have a `radio` group with three options.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 27.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-27.png)

We see the textfields and checkboxes we added before as individual fields, but the options we just added are grouped together.

Because radios only allow one of the options to be selected, we have to group radio options together so we know which options belong together.

If we now open the document in Fill & Sign, we have a radio where only one of the options can be selected.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 28.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-28.png)

And if we go back to the editor and select all of the options in the group, we can make the group required:

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 29.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-29.png)

The fields for our document are now ready. You can publish the current version of the document by clicking the "Publish" button in the top-left corner.

![Creating your first Fill & Sign Document/Untitled 30.png](/img/fill-and-sign/creating-your-first-fill-and-sign-document/Untitled-30.png)

Once published, you will see the button turn green.

You can learn more about our "Draft & Publish" feature here:

[Draft & Publish](draft-and-publish)

We've published our Fill & Sign document, but we have yet to specify what should happen after the user has filled out and signed the document. You can learn how to configure the document's delivery here:

[WIP: Document Delivery](wip-document-delivery)

Once the document's delivery has been set up, you can move onto adding it to your company's website:

There are lots of shortcuts to make working with the Fill & Sign Editor easier. You can learn more about them here:

[Keyboard Shortcuts](/docs/fill-and-sign/editor/keyboard-shortcuts/symbol-table)

If your document needs to be signed by multiple people, you can learn how to specify the number of signees here:

[Multiple Signees](multiple-signees)

If you need to take your Fill & Sign document down, you can learn how to deactivate it here:
