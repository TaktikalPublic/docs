title: Deactivate a flow
---

If a Fill & Sign flow should no longer be accessible, it can be hidden without deleting it by making it inactive.

You can find the "Active" property within "Edit Flow" within the Fill & Sign Editor:

![Multiple%20Signees%2035890f2c91c6407d811eec563baf4ca1/Untitled.png](/img/fill-and-sign/deactivate-a-flow/Untitled.png)

Within the modal that appears, you can uncheck the "Active" property:

![Deactivate%20a%20flow%2083aa36f2e78a4065ad8109eece3ee737/Untitled.png](/img/fill-and-sign/deactivate-a-flow/Untitled.png)

Once a Fill & Sign flow has been deactivated, users will encounter a "Not Found" when they attempt to open it.
