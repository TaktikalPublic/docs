title: Multiple Signees
---

The Fill & Sign product allows specifying a minimum and maximum number of signees that must sign the document.

The two properties that determine the number of signees to sign the document are:

- Min additional signees
- Max additional signees

You can modify these properties within "Edit flow":

![Multiple Signees/Untitled.png](/img/fill-and-sign/multiple-signees/Untitled.png)

Within the modal that appears, you can set the min and max additional signees:

![Multiple Signees/Untitled 1.png](/img/fill-and-sign/multiple-signees/Untitled-01.png)

If we want exactly two persons to sign the document, we can set both of these to 1:

![Multiple Signees/Untitled 2.png](/img/fill-and-sign/multiple-signees/Untitled-02.png)

If we want 1-3 persons to sign the document, we can do by setting min to 0 and max to 2:
