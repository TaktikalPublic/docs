All Fill & Sign Documents have a unique Public URL that they can be accessed at.
These URLs look like so:

```
htts://fill.taktikal.is/s/:flowKey
```

This link can be sent via Email or Direct Message. It can also be added to a
website or a post on social media.

If you would like to have the UI in English you can add the query parameter `?lng=en-us`, resulting in:

```
htts://fill.taktikal.is/s/:flowKey?lng=en-us
```
