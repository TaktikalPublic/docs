Integrations are only available for business- and enterprise plan.

## Ready integrations

Currently available integrations include `50skills`, `Alfre√∞` and `Zapier`.

Only company administrators are able to modify an installation. A non-company
administrator can however request an installation which will trigger an e-mail
to be sent to all company administrator with a request to install the
corresponding integration.

We are working on integrations with `Salesforce` and `Slack`.

## Requesting an integration

We do however value our customers feedback thus we encourage sending us a line
from the form which can be accessed at the bottom of the page via
`Not finding an integration?` button.

This way we can prioritise integrations that are eagerly sought-after.
