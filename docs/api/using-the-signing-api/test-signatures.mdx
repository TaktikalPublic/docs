### Signing with test Ssn

On `dev` we can use any of the test signees.

When using the test users you still need to go to the link and click
through the process. This was made to test the signing experience.

### Standard Signatures
When requested for otp code you can enter any number combination
<TestStandardSignatures />

#### Example
```json
{
    "Name": "John Doe",
    "PhoneNumber": "+12222222222",
    "Email": "my@email.com",
    "SignatureType": "Simple"
}
```

### Fully Qualified Signatures

    "Ssn": "6000101990",
    "PhoneNumber": "2222222",
